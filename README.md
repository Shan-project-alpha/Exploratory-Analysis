# PortfolioOptimiser
This programme analyses a basket of stocks, providing you key metrics from historical returns to the sharpe ratio. 
It also calculates covariance and correlation, in order to then construct an efficient frontier. 
Optimisation occurs with both max sharpe ratio and min volatility. 
Option to then export all of this to an excel file for easy access.
